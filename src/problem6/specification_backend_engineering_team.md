# Token Lifecycle and Validation
ActionToken Generation:
Generated by the backend when the user completes an action (e.g., finishing a game level).
ActionTokens are unique strings tied to specific actions and users.
ActionToken Expiration:
Tokens are valid for 5 minutes after they are generated.
One-Time Use:
After an actionToken is used to update the score, it cannot be used again.
Rate Limiting:
Users can only request a new actionToken once every 30 seconds.
ActionToken Validation:
Each actionToken must be validated by the backend before the score update is processed.
The backend checks if the actionToken has expired, been used, or belongs to the correct user and action.

# Data Models
Action Token Model:

CREATE TABLE action_tokens (
  token VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,  // Unique action token string
  user_id INT,                     // ID of the user who completed the action
  action_id INT,                   // ID of the action that was completed
  created_at TIMESTAMP,            // When the token was generated
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,            // When the token expires
  used BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE       // Indicates whether the token has been used
);
Score Model:

CREATE TABLE scores (
  user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,   // The user’s ID
  score INT                  // The user's current score
);

# Workflow Overview
1. User Completes an Action
The user completes an action (such as finishing a level, task, or achievement).
The frontend calls the /actions/complete endpoint with the user’s ID and action ID.
2. Backend Generates an ActionToken
The backend validates the action base on the info client POST in /actions/complet and, if valid, generates an actionToken.
The backend stores the actionToken with an expiration time and associates it with the user and the completed action.
3. Frontend Sends ActionToken for Score Update
The frontend sends the actionToken along with the score increase value to the /scores/update endpoint.
4. Backend Validates the ActionToken
The backend checks if the actionToken:
Belongs to the correct user
Has not expired
Has not already been used
If valid, the backend updates the user’s score and returns the new score.
5. Real-Time Scoreboard Update
The score is updated in the database.
The system broadcasts the updated scoreboard (top 10 users) in real time to all connected clients.
# Security and Anti-Cheat Measures
JWT Authentication:

All endpoints require the user to be authenticated via JWT (JSON Web Token). This ensures that only authorized users can update their scores.
ActionToken Validation:

The backend checks that the actionToken is valid and corresponds to the correct action and user.
Rate Limiting:

Users can only request an actionToken once every 30 seconds to prevent spamming and abuse.
One-Time Use:

Each actionToken can only be used once to update the score.
Logging:

All actions and score updates are logged for monitoring, auditing, and debugging purposes.
