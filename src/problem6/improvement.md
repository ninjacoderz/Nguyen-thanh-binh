# Improvements and Future Considerations
Rate Limiting:

Consider implementing IP-based rate limiting or user session rate limiting to prevent abuse and high-frequency attacks from single users or clients.
Cache for Scoreboard:

To reduce database load, the top 10 scores can be cached and updated periodically or on significant score changes.
User Action Context:

Actions could be tied to specific game levels, milestones, or other criteria to ensure that actions are more meaningful and harder to fake.
Expiration and Invalidation of Action Tokens:

Ensure that expired or used tokens are properly cleaned up in the database to prevent lingering, invalid tokens.
Real-time Scoreboard:

Consider using WebSockets to send live updates of the top 10 scores to the frontend in real-time, making the experience more interactive.
